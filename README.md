This program makes a window with Conway's Game of life, two buttons, and two labels that count the amount of cells alive and dead.
One button is to reset the game which sets random amount of dead and alive cells to the game.
The other button is to run the game. Each time the run button is pushed the game is itterated.
When the game is itterated each cell will be determined if it will be dead or alive by the amount of alive cells around it.
If it has to many alive cells next to it, the cell will not have enough food and die. If there is no alive cells near it, the cell will die by loneliness.
The two labels go through the grid and count the amount alive and display it and then goes through the grid and counts how many are dead.
